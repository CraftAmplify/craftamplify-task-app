- Always check the design system files first (src/components/ui/*.ts, src/components/ui/*.tsx)
- Follow the established component patterns and variants
- Use predefined design tokens instead of custom CSS
- Check button-variants.ts for available options before suggesting button modifications
- Maintain consistency with existing component APIs
- Reference the constants file (src/constants/index.ts) for any magic values
- Always strive for best practices in frontend code
- WARN ME IF ANY RECOMMENDATION DOES NOT MEET THESE STANDARDS
